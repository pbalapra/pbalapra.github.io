                    Since March 2023, I am leading Oak Ridge National Laboratory's <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/ai-initiative" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence Initiative</a>, wherein I direct laboratory research, 
                    development and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to solve problems of national importance. I seek to deliver foundational, scalable, and applied AI/ML capabilities supporting 
                    Oak Ridge National Laboratory's broad mission and provide world-class solutions in computer and computational science, neutron science, materials science, biology and health science, 
                    nuclear engineering, isotopes, manufacturing, energy, and climate science.
