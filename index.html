                    My research focuses on the development of scalable, data-efficient machine learning methods for scientific applications.
                    My research interests span the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, optimization,
                    and high-performance computing. Currently, my research focus is on the
                    design and development of scalable machine learning algorithms for solving large-scale
                    problems that arise in scientific data analysis and in automating
                    application performance modeling/tuning. The overarching goal of my research is to
                    advance the state of the art in scientific data analysis and high-performance computing
                    by increasing the applicability of machine learning and numerical optimization
                    approaches and by improving their performance on leadership-class systems.
