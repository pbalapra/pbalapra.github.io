 SPAPT: Search Problems in Automatic Performance Tuning,
  2011.
 A set of extensible and portable search problems in automatic
  performance tuning whose goal is to aid in the development and improvement of
  search strategies and performance-improving transformations. SPAPT contains
  representative implementations from a number of lower-level, serial
  performance-tuning tasks in scientific applications. Available with the Orio
  autotuning framework.

 The irace Package: Iterated Race for Automatic Algorithm
  Configuration, 2010.
 The irace package implements the iterated racing procedure, which is
  an extension of the Iterated F-race procedure. Its main purpose is to
  automatically configure optimization algorithms by finding the most
  appropriate settings given a set of instances of an optimization problem. It
  builds upon the race package by Birattari, and it is implemented in R.

 ELS-PTSP: Estimation-based Local Search for the Probabilistic
  Traveling Salesman Problem, 2009.
 This software package provides a high-performance implementation of
  the estimation-based iterative improvement algorithm to tackle the
  probabilistic traveling salesman problem. A key novelty of the proposed
  algorithm is that the cost difference between two neighbor solutions is
  estimated by partial evaluation, adaptive, and importance sampling. Developed
  in C with GNU scientific library under Linux.
