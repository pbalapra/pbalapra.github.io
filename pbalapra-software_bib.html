  note = {This software package provides a high-performance implementation of the estimation-based iterative improvement algorithm to tackle the probabilistic traveling salesman problem. A key novelty of the proposed algorithm is that the cost difference between two neighbor solutions is estimated by partial evaluation, adaptive, and importance sampling. Developed in C with GNU scientific library under Linux. },

  note = {The irace package implements the iterated racing procedure, which is an extension of the Iterated F-race procedure. Its main purpose is to automatically configure optimization algorithms by finding the most appropriate settings given a set of instances of an optimization problem. It builds upon the race package by Birattari, and it is implemented in R},
