  note = {In recent years, automatic data-driven modeling with machine learning (ML) has received considerable attention as an alternative to analytical modeling for many modeling tasks. While ad hoc adoption of ML approaches has obtained success, the real potential for automation in data-driven modeling has yet to be achieved. In this talk, we will describe AutoMOMML, an end-to-end, ML-based framework to build predictive models for objectives such as performance, and power. The framework adopts statistical approaches to reduce the modeling complexity and automatically identifies and configures the most suitable learning algorithm to model the required objectives based on hardware and application signatures. },

  note = {This software package provides a high-performance implementation of the estimation-based iterative improvement algorithm to tackle the probabilistic traveling salesman problem. A key novelty of the proposed algorithm is that the cost difference between two neighbor solutions is estimated by partial evaluation, adaptive, and importance sampling. Developed in C with GNU scientific library under Linux.},
